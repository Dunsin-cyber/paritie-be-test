# Paritie Skill Test – Wallet & Donation Service

This project implements a simple wallet and donation API with built-in transaction safety, pagination, and authentication.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Default Wallet Balance**: Every user automatically gets a wallet with a starting balance of **100,000 units**.
- **Send Funds by Email**: Users can send funds to beneficiaries using their registered email address.
- **Automatic Transaction Rollback**: Built-in safety mechanism in the **create donation** endpoint ensures that if any part of the process fails, funds are **automatically reversed**.
- **Pagination Support**: All resource fetch endpoints (users, donations, wallets) include pagination for efficient data retrieval.
- **Authentication**: Secure login & signup flow. Every request to protected endpoints requires a valid JWT access token.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Dunsin-cyber/paritie-be-test

# 2. Install dependencies
yarn install

# 3. Copy environment variables
cp .env.example .env
```

### ⚙️ Environment Setup

You need a PostgreSQL database connection string.
Create a database from any **Postgres provider** and copy the connection URL.
It should look like this:

```
postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE
```

Set this value in your `.env` file as `DATABASE_URL`.
Also fill in other required values like:

- `NODE_ENV`
- `JWT_SECRET`
- `PORT` etc

## ▶️ Running the Project

Start the development server with:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Run the seed data
`yarn db:seed` to create a paritie system account

If everything is working, you’ll see logs like this:

```bash
[nodemon] starting `ts-node -r tsconfig-paths/register src/server.ts`
Application started with config Loaded up✅
Server running on port [PORT]
API documentation available at 📝📚 http://localhost:[PORT]/api-docs
```

Now you can open the documentation link in your browser to test the APIs.
